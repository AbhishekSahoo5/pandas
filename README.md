Data Analysis
---------------
    Data Analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, information conclusions, and supporting decision-making.




Python Libraries for Data Analysis
-------------------------------------
    NumPy
    statsmodel
    matplotlib
    scipy
    scikit learn
    pandas
    seaborn



What is Pandas?
------------------
--> The name "pandas" has a reference to both "panal data", and "python data analysis" and was created by wes mckinney in 2008.
--> Pandas is python library used for working with data sets.
--> It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring and manipulating data.
--> Read and write data structure and different formats: csv, XML, JSON, ZIP etc.



Pandas Data structure
-----------------------
Three Data Structure:
    Series-- 1D labeled arrays pd.Series(data)

    DataFrames-- 2D data structure with columns, much like a table.

    Panel: A panel is a 3D container of data.



Pandas installation
--------------------
pip install pandas


Pandas import
-----------------
import pandas as pd



Importance of Pandas in Python
--------------------------------
--> Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusion based on statistical theories.

--> Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevent.

--> Easy handling od missing data(represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data.

--> Size mutability:- Columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame nd higher dimensional objects.

--> Data set merging and joining:- Flexible reshaping and npivoting of data sets Pandas time series functionality.


    
Data Structure in Python Pandas
-----------------------------------
The Pandas provides two data structure for processing the data.

    Series, DataFrame and Panel



Series
---------
It defined as a 1D array that is capable of storing various data types.

import pandas as pd
a=pd.Series()
print(a)
