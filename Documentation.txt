Data Analysis
--------------
Data analysis is a process of inpecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making


Python libraries for Data Analysis
-----------------------------------
NumPy
statsmodel
matplotlib
scipy
scikit learn
pandas
seaborn


What is pandas??
----------------
---The name "pandas" has reference to both "panel data" and "python data analysis" and was created by wes mickinney in 2008.
---Pandas is a python library used for working with data sets.
---It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring and manipulating data.
---Read and write data structures and different formats: csv, xml, JSON, zip etc..


Pandas Data structures
------------------------
Three Data Structure:

Series:---> 1D labeled arrays pd.series(data)
DataFrames:---> 2D data structure with columns, much like a table
Panel:---> A panel is a 3D container of data.


Importance of Pandas in Python
--------------------------------
---> Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
---> Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
---> Easy handling of missing data(represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data.
---> Size Mutability: Columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects.
---> Data set merging nd joining: Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets Pro time series functionality.


series
----------
It is defines as a 1D array that is capable of sorting various data types.

import pandas as pd
a=pd.Series()
print(a)

Difference Between CSV and XLS(excel) file formats
----------------------------------------------------
--> CSV format is a plain text format in which values are separated by commas(Comma Separated Values).
--> XLS file format is an Excel sheets binary file format which holds information about all the worksheets in a file, including both content and formatting.


CSV Files
-----------
---> A simple way to store big data sets is to use CSV files(Comma seperated files).
---> CSV files contains plain text and is a well know format thet can be read everyone including Pandas.
